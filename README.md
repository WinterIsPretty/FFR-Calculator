# FFR-Calculator
A calculator I made for FFR (Flash Flash Revolution) to find out statistics for certain files and to make theoretical decisions. I made this a long time ago.

Essentially you type in a score and then receive some statistics you do not see in-game and you can test different paths such as the percentage and equivalent osu grade. The most useful thing about this is the number of credits and AAA equivalency you can recieve based on the difficulty.
